### This repository contains MERN+ stack experements, including

1. dockerized microservices for authentication, API-gateway, MongoDB, and MySQL databases, with further extensions to the specific functionality according to the business profile.
2. Micro-UI solution (Module Federation) *Core: React* Remote: Angular standalone components: The Angular repository is serving as a component factory. * Remote store: a solution to enable state sharing between isolated components that connects to both Angular-Remote and React-Host
3. i18-next internationalization
4. bootstrap theming (dark/light mode)
5. PassportJs playground with local strategy and JWT strategy
6. MongoDB and Mongoose integration to store user-related information #### How it works Make sure to have Docker Compose installed. Run the command *docker-compose up --build* in the root of the repository. That will pull all the required images according to the docker-compose.yaml configuration and deploy the application.

To remove unused containers (cleanup):
in the root of the repository, run the *docker system prune --all --force* command. Other useful commands:

###### sudo docker-compose run web "ping" "authentication"

###### docker-compose up --build

###### docker system prune --all --force

###### docker ps

*login to container*

###### docker exec -it web sh

*exit from container*

###### exit

*some docker-networking tools to investigate connectivity issues:*

###### sudo docker-compose run web "ping" "authentication"

###### sudo docker-compose run web "curl" "<http://<RemoteAddress>/remoteEntry.js>"

### Development setup

To run containerized dev:

###### docker compose -f ./docker-compose-dev.yml up --build

1. Spin up the containers.
2. Stop the targeted container.
3. Go to the desired folder with the source code (*cd web* for example, in the command line).
4. run *npm i* and *npm start*
5. Hint: Node applications could be debugged according to your preferred IDE recommendations.

## Happy Coding;)
